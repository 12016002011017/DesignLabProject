# Team Maven : Credit Card Approval System
Design Lab Project 
# Problem Statement
Small businesses must seek credit approval to obtain funds from lenders, investors, and vendors, and also grant credit approval to their customers. Banking industries receive so many applications for credit card request. Going through each request manually can be very time consuming, also prone to human errors. However, if we can use the historical data to build a model which can shortlist the candidates for approval that can be great.
